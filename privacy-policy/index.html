												<p>Additionally, in order to use the OpDemand Products you must have cookies enabled. Most browsers allow you to remove and block cookies and web beacons. If you do block cookies you will not be able to use the OpDemand Products.</p>

																				<p>We may obtain information from other sources and merge this with information we have previously collected. This includes information about accounts you may have with other service providers as needed in order to provide you with the complete set of services and functionality available from OpDemand (collectively, “Third Party PII”).</p>

																				<p>If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), the person providing the PII must have consent to do so from the person whose information is being provided to OpDemand. Certain parts of the OpDemand Products may be offered in conjunction with another company. If you provide PII in these cases, both OpDemand and the other company(ies) may receive the information collected and use the information according to each company's privacy policy and agreement with you.</p>

																				<p>2. <strong>How we use your PII</strong></p>

																				<p>OpDemand uses and retains your PII for a variety of reasons, including: to support the OpDemand Products; to send you other information about OpDemand, its services and products; to better understand your needs and interests; to refine and develop our business; to improve services; and, to ensure a quality experience for users of the OpDemand Products and Websites. For example, we may use your information to send you relevant promotions and information about OpDemand and affiliated third-parties, identify and communicate offers of products, programs and services that may be of interest to you, personalize content and advertising or for other marketing and business development purposes. We may also use your information to comply with legal requirements or enforce terms of service and website terms of use, and prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities.</p>

																				<p>3. <strong>Sharing and Disclosing Your PII</strong></p>

																				<p>OpDemand will not sell or knowingly disclose your PII to any third party except with your consent or as otherwise listed below. We may compile or derive statistical information from your PII to be aggregated with the statistical information compiled or derived from other visitors to the Websites or users of the OpDemand Products. However, such statistical information will be anonymous and not attributed to you. We use aggregated statistical information to better serve the users of our products and services and improve the manner in which the business of OpDemand is conducted. We may share or disclose your PII as follows:</p>

																				<ul>
																						<li>To corporate subsidiaries we own or control to support their business and marketing processes;</li>
																							<li>To our service providers and suppliers, who are acting and using your information on our behalf;</li>
																								<li>Based on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or safety of any person or entity;</li>
																									<li>In the event that OpDemand is sold, merges with another company or any of its assets are acquired, your information may be transferred with the company or the asset;</li>
																										<li>To other third-parties for purposes you have allowed or consented to; or</li>
																											<li>When posted by you or an authorized third-party to our wikis, forums, blogs, message boards, chat rooms and other social networking environments.</li>
																										</ul>

																										<p>In addition, OpDemand may be compelled or determine it is necessary or appropriate to disclose your personal information to the government or third parties in connection with law enforcement actions and legal disputes involving fraud, misappropriation of intellectual property, infringement of intellectual property rights or other conduct that may expose us to liability, or as required by law.</p>

																										<p>We only share PII with third parties if we believe those third parties provide an adequate level of data protection to help ensure the security of personal data. However, we cannot and do not provide any guarantee that such third parties data protection will be sufficient to protect your PII and we are not responsible for third party security.</p>

																										<p>Please be aware that the Websites may contain links to other websites that are owned and operated by third parties and you may also access third-party cloud providers through the OpDemand Products. The information and privacy practices of such websites or third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Those third parties may have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of such third parties.</p>

																										<p>4. <strong>Security and Storage</strong></p>

																										<p>OpDemand works hard to safeguard your personal information, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. These safeguards are designed to protect against, but are not a guarantee against, the loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of PII. These safeguards are not perfect, however, and OpDemand cannot promise that your PII will never be disclosed. In addition, there is no such thing as perfect security regarding information transmitted by way of the Internet. Unauthorized third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions containing your personal information. Therefore, OpDemand does not promise, and you should not expect, that your PII will remain private under all circumstances. OpDemand will not be liable for any security breaches, including any disclosure of Third Party PII which may result from a breach in OpDemand’s security safeguards; and OpDemand specifically disclaims any liability whatsoever for security breaches or unauthorized access to your PII or Third Party PII.</p>

																										<p>Your PII may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which OpDemand, its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. OpDemand, its affiliates or service providers may transfer your PII across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer your PII to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. By using the OpDemand Products or Websites, you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which OpDemand, its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of your PII.</p>

																										<p>Following termination of your use of the OpDemand Products, we may retain information (including PII) for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes.</p>

																										<p>5. <strong>Access to and Right to Decline to Provide PII</strong></p>

																										<p>We provide individuals with reasonable access to their PII in order to correct, amend or delete it where it is inaccurate or inappropriate for the specified purpose.</p>

																										<p>If you need to review, update or correct your PII, please email us at privacy@opdemand.com.</p>

																										<p>After making changes, we may keep a copy of the prior information for our records.</p>

																										<p>In some instances, you can choose whether or not to provide your PII to us. If you choose not to provide PII, you can continue to interact with OpDemand, but you may be not be able to take advantage of certain offers, options, events and services that depend upon OpDemand having access to accurate PII. In particular, use of the OpDemand Products requires that cookies and web beacons are enabled. Certain methods of collecting PII cannot be opted out of as they are built into and required for use of OpDemand services and products.  The only way to completely avoid providing any PII is to refrain from using any OpDemand services or products.</p>

																										<p>6. <strong>Children</strong></p>

																										<p>The Websites, the OpDemand Products and our marketing are not intended for or directed to children under 18 years of age. OpDemand does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 18.
